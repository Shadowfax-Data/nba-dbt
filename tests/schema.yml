  - name: assert_max_win_streak_consistency
    description: >
      Validates that the max_win_streak values in nba_team_stats are consistent with
      what can be calculated directly from the game results in nba_elo_history.
      The test recalculates win streaks from the source data and compares them with
      the reported values. Any discrepancies are returned as test failures.
